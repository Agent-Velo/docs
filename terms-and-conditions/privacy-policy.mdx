Welcome to Aerspan. This Privacy Policy explains how Agent Velo, LLC (“**Aerspan**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**”) collects, uses, discloses, and otherwise processes personal data in connection with our website, https://aerspan.com, and our related application programming interfaces (APIs), content, and services (collectively, the “**Service**”).

This Privacy Policy is not a contract and does not create any legal rights or obligations. By accessing or using our Service, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

#### **1. Our Core Privacy Commitments**

Your trust is important to us. We are committed to the following principles to protect your privacy:

*   **No AI Training on Your Data:** We do not use your prompts, API inputs, or any generated outputs (“**User Content**”) to train or improve our AI models without your explicit, opt-in consent.
*   **You Control Your Data:** You can access, review, or request deletion of your account information at any time through the Service or by contacting us.
*   **Limited Retention of User Content:** We process User Content primarily to provide the Service to you. We may retain User Content for a limited period where necessary for service delivery, security, abuse prevention, debugging, legal compliance, or dispute resolution. We do not use User Content to train or improve AI models without your explicit, opt-in consent.

#### **2. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Last Updated” date at the top of this policy. If we make material changes, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you, such as by sending an email to the address associated with your account, posting a notice on our Service, or by other means consistent with applicable law. Your continued use of the Service after any such update constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy.

#### **3. What is Personal Data?**

For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, “**personal data**” means any information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular individual or household.

#### **4. How We Collect and Use Your Personal Data**

We collect personal data from various sources to provide and improve our Service.

**4.1. Information You Provide to Us**

You may directly provide us with personal data when you use the Service. This includes:

*   **Payment Information:** When you purchase credits or subscribe to a paid plan, we collect payment information, such as credit or debit card details and billing address.

We use this information to process your payments and fulfill our contract.

We use this information in our legitimate interests to operate and secure the Service, prevent fraud, analyze usage, and improve our offerings.
*   **Cookies and Similar Technologies:** We use cookies (small text files placed on your device) and similar tracking technologies to operate the Service, remember your preferences, and gather analytics information. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features of the Service.

**4.3. Information We Receive from Third Parties**

We may receive personal data about you from third-party sources, including:

*   **Authentication Services:** You may choose to log in to our Service using a third-party authentication service (e.g., Google, GitHub). When you do so, you authorize us to receive certain account information from that service, such as your name and email address, as permitted by your privacy settings on that service. We use this information to create and secure your account.

#### **5. User Content (Prompts and Outputs)**

As an AI service provider, we process the prompts you submit and the outputs you receive.

*   **Use of User Content:** We process User Content to provide the Service, including generating responses and maintaining service reliability, security, and integrity. We will not use User Content to train or improve our AI models unless you provide explicit, opt-in consent.
*   **Retention of User Content:** We may retain User Content for a limited period, including in logs or backups, where reasonably necessary for purposes such as security monitoring, abuse detection, debugging, legal compliance, or enforcing our Terms of Service. Retention periods vary depending on the purpose and are subject to appropriate safeguards.
*   **Responsibility for User Content:** You are solely responsible for your User Content and must ensure that it complies with our Terms of Service and all applicable laws. This includes ensuring you have the necessary rights and permissions for any data you submit.

#### **6. How We Disclose Your Information**

We do not sell your personal data. We may disclose your personal data to the following categories of third parties for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy:

*   **Service Providers:** We share personal data with third-party vendors and service providers that perform services on our behalf, such as payment processing (Stripe), cloud hosting, infrastructure provisioning, and customer support. These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and use it only for the services we have engaged them to provide.
*   **Business Transactions:** In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your personal data may be transferred to a successor or affiliate as part of that transaction.
*   **Legal Obligations and Rights:** We may disclose personal data to third parties, such as legal advisors and law enforcement, if we believe in good faith that it is necessary to:
    *   Comply with a legal obligation, lawful request, or legal process.
    *   Protect and defend our rights, property, or safety, or that of our users or the public.
    *   Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service.
    *   Enforce our Terms of Service.
*   **With Your Consent:** We may disclose your personal data to other third parties with your explicit consent.

#### **7. Your Rights and Choices**

You have certain rights and choices regarding your personal data. Depending on your location, these may include:

*   **Access, Correction, and Deletion:** You may access, correct, or delete your account information at any time through your account settings or by contacting us. If you delete your account, we will take steps to delete your personal data from our systems within a reasonable period, subject to any legal retention obligations.
*   **Email Communications:** You can opt out of receiving promotional emails from us by clicking the “unsubscribe” link in any such email. Please note that you cannot opt out of essential, service-related communications (e.g., account verification, billing confirmations, and technical notices).
*   **Cookies:** Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. You can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies.

To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at support@aerspan.com. We will not discriminate against you for exercising your privacy rights. We may need to verify your identity before processing your request.

#### **8. Data Security and Retention**

We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, or destruction. However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.

We retain your personal data for as long as is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, to provide our Service, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, and to comply with our legal obligations.

For clarity, retention practices differ by data category. Account, billing, and compliance-related data may be retained for longer periods as required by law, while User Content is retained only for limited periods consistent with the purposes described above.

#### **9. Third-Party Links**

Our Service may contain links to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by us. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties, and we are not responsible for their privacy policies or practices. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Service and to read the privacy policies of any third-party website or service that you visit.

#### **10. Children’s Privacy**

Our Service is not directed to, and is not intended for use by, individuals under the age of eighteen (18). We do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose personal data from individuals under 18 years of age.

If we become aware that we have collected personal data from an individual under the age of 18, we will take reasonable steps to delete such information as promptly as possible. If you are a parent or legal guardian and believe that a minor has provided us with personal data, please contact us at support@aerspan.com.

#### **11. International Data Transfers**

Aerspan is operated by Agent Velo, LLC, a company based in the United States. Your personal data will be processed and stored in the United States. If you are using the Service from outside the United States, you acknowledge that your personal data may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States, where data protection laws may be different from those in your jurisdiction.
