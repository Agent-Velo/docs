NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM AERSPAN OR THROUGH THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED HEREIN. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, AERSPAN, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, ITS AFFILIATES, AND ITS LICENSORS DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE CONTENT OR OUTPUT IS ACCURATE, RELIABLE, OR CORRECT; THAT THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS; THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE AVAILABLE AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME OR LOCATION, UNINTERRUPTED OR SECURE; THAT ANY DEFECTS OR ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED; OR THAT THE SERVICE IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL AERSPAN BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE, LOSS, OR INJURY RESULTING FROM HACKING, TAMPERING, OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR USE OF THE SERVICE OR YOUR ACCOUNT OR THE INFORMATION CONTAINED THEREIN.

THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SECTION APPLIES WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF AERSPAN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

#### **11. Governing Law, Arbitration, and Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver**

**11.1. Governing Law.** These Terms shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.

**11.2. Arbitration.** READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM AERSPAN. For any dispute with Aerspan, you agree to first contact us at support@aerspan.com and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Aerspan has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after sixty (60) days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy arising out of or in connection with these Terms exclusively through binding arbitration by JAMS before a single arbitrator. The arbitration will be conducted in Sussex County, Delaware, unless you and Aerspan agree otherwise.

**11.3. Class Action/Jury Trial Waiver.** ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND AERSPAN ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

#### **12. Export Controls**

You agree to comply with all applicable U.S. and non-U.S. export control and trade sanctions laws. You may not use the Service if you are the subject of U.S. sanctions or of sanctions consistent with U.S. law imposed by the governments of the country where you are using the Service. You are responsible for complying with all applicable local laws in your jurisdiction.

#### **13. General Provisions**

**13.1. Assignment.** These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Aerspan without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.

**13.2.

Aerspan reserves the right to modify or update these Terms from time to time. When we change the Terms in a material manner, we will update the ‘Last Updated’ date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service.

**13.3. Entire Agreement/Severability.** These Terms, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Aerspan in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Aerspan concerning the Service. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall remain in full force and effect.

**13.4. No Waiver.** No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Aerspan’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
